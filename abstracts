Enterprise User's Meeting:

Title: The Kernel Community - who they are and how it works

Abstract:
Linux is a widely know OS platform used by many enterprise systems such as the
trading systems at Tokyo Stock Exchange.
And it is also well known that Linux is developed by a group of software
developers called "Community."

However, it is not well know who are the "Community" and how it works, and this
is the main topic of this session.
Enterprise user companies may think that Linux is something they use passively
as provided by the distributors. But there are opportunities for enterprise
users to actively participate to the community to grow Linux for their own
sake.


Open Compliance Summit:

Title: Understanding the Kernel Community - the fundamental of license
compliance

Abstract:
"Open Source License Compliance" is essentially meaning that companies need to
comply with the requested terms of the original authors of the software  (=
Community developers) . 
Thus it makes sense to have better understanding on what motivate open source
developers to write codes and how those developers work together in the
"Community." 

In this talk, I will be talking about the Linux Kernel Community. 
I will be answering a key questions such as who they are and why they come
together to collaboratively write codes, and above all, how the Kernel
Community works.

I am also touch upon why it makes more sense for the companies to work with the
Community.
Closed (Forked) Kernel modules tend to be illegal, unworkable, and immoral.
Working closely with the community should avoid these issues.
