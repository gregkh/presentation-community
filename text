kernel community - who they are and how it works

Normal talk, see the slides, no big deal...

Title: Understanding the Kernel Community - the fundamental of license
compliance

Abstract:
"Open Source License Compliance" is essentially meaning that companies need to
comply with the requested terms of the original authors of the software  (=
Community developers) . 
Thus it makes sense to have better understanding on what motivate open source
developers to write codes and how those developers work together in the
"Community." 

In this talk, I will be talking about the Linux Kernel Community. 
I will be answering a key questions such as who they are and why they come
together to collaboratively write codes, and above all, how the Kernel
Community works.

I am also touch upon why it makes more sense for the companies to work with the
Community.
Closed (Forked) Kernel modules tend to be illegal, unworkable, and immoral.
Working closely with the community should avoid these issues.

My notes:

Start with previous talk, 

Add how to work with community slides (roadmap, quote from Intel/IBM)

and then add:

  - License of the kernel
	- GPLv2 only
	- copyright held by contributor
	- some files dual licensed for inclusion in other OSes / projects
		- ACPI - in other OSes
		- Read-Copy-Update - copy in userspace under LGPLv2

   - Closed source modules
	- Unworkable
		- Cost way too much money to even try to accomplish
			- millions of dollars
		- Constantly behind the curve
		- Breaks your customer's support contracts, makes your
		  customers mad
		- You get no help from the community, makes the community mad
		  as your bugs are referred to them.

	- Immoral
		- Why is your tiny bit of code somehow more important than the
		  rest of the kernel which you depend on?
		- No one is forcing you to use Linux, if you use Linux, abide
		  by the license, it's only fair, do you break licenses of your
		  business partners?
		- Do you want to upset all of the contributors to the kernel
		  who you probably copied the source from as to how to write
		  your code?
