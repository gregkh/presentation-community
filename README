This is a repo containing a presentation about the Linux kernel
community that I gave in Japan in 2014 at two different conferences
(hence the two presentations, both a lot alike but with subtle
differences.)

Feel free to use the slides and info in here in any presentations you
wish to give, just properly attribute them please.
